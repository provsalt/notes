# Bar graphs
Bar graphs allows multiple data to be easily compared to different sets of data
 allowing patterns to be found easily.
 
 However it is also hard to predict trends and changes over time cannot be mapped.

## Simple bar graph
Only 1 set of data, 1 dependant and 1 independent variable.
## Comparative line graph
Comparative bar graph is used to compare more than 2 sets of data and is colour coded accordingly.
## Compound line graph
Similarly to [[Line graph#Compound line graph]], compound bar graph is used to subdivide a set of data into two or more sets of data and can be converted to percentage.
