# Geographical investigation
Geographical investigation requires a few steps to carry out investigation to come out with a conclusion from the data given

Steps:
1. Formulate guiding question and hypothesis
2. Identify and gather data
3. Interpret and analyse the data
4. Reflect and conclude the research.

# Guiding question and hypothesis
Guiding question leads you to the hypothesis
Eg: Do European tourist come to Singapore for eco-tourism?
Eg: Is Singapore rainfall considered moderate?

Hypothesis is a statement that you want to prove or disprove.

The hypothesis has to contain 
- Variables to study and if it's able to be measured or tested
- The correct order of variable. Independent first (causes), followed by dependent variable (offset)
- Use competitive terms when formulating a hypothesis

# Reflective thinking
How successful the investigation is? Did it prove the hypothesis

Describe the strengths and limitation of the investigation.
Eg: What could you improve ...
	Breath: Increase numbers of days/ increase number of data collected -> more profile covered, more representative.
	Depth: Can do interviews with people, changing data collection method.
	Questionnaire, improve question so more open ended questions
	Conduct pilot survey (test survey), see if tourist are able to understand the question you ask.
