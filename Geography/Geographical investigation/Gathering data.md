# Gathering data
There are two of the prominent ways to gather data to prove the hypothesis.

## Primary data
Data that you collect through the investigation

### Sampling
Sampling can be done to collect data from total population by taking a sample (a small group of the population)

It is conducted through various [[Sampling methods]]
### Questionnaire
A questionnaire can be a set of questions to be answered by a group of people.

The guiding question should guide you to the questions that you are creating.

There are differences between a close ended question and an open ended question. A close ended question typically only allow you to choose between the choices like yes or no however open ended allows a person to give more in depth details. Therefore close ended questions are better to answer hypothesis.

### Interview 
Interviews are one to one face to face meeting between the interviewer and the interviewee

To get an interviewee:
1. Identify the potential interviewee through the [[Sampling methods]] 
2. Introduce yourself and provide your objective.
3. Invite the interviewee and appreciate them for their effort.

### Bipolar survey
Bipolar survey is used widely as it uses a scale to measure and evaluate perception
Example of a response from a responder about a park
| Positive aspects         | +2  | +1  | 0   | -1  | -2  | Negative aspect      |
| ------------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------------------- |
| Good scenery             | x   |     |     |     |     | Terrible scenery     |
| Good food stalls         |     | x   |     |     |     | Food tasted horrible |
| The place is litter free |     |     |     | x   |     |                      |
| Not too noisy            |     |     | x   |     |     | Very noisy           | 

To calculate add all together
(2 x 1) + (1  x 1) + (1 x -1) = 2
\>0 = positive  < 0 = negative
### Land use survey
Land use survey show how the land is being used in the area which can be an inference of the profile of tourist visiting the area. 
Eg: If a lot of souvenir shops, it may be a tourist site

To conduct the survey, just walk around the area and gather information about the shops and record it down their categories.
## Secondary data
Data that has already been collected by someone else for another purpose
Eg: Newspaper, Websites or Video's
