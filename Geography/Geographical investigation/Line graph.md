# Line graphs
Line graphs are used to show trends over a period of time (GSA) and used to compare multiple set of data easily which allows someone to predict the future trend.

It may also be bad if the data is small as it does not allow it to be easily comparable and the data has to be continuous.

## Comparative line graph
Comparative line graph is used when more than 1 dependant variable is used which allows the variables to be compared to one another. However, it's usually 2 set of data
## Compound line graph
Similarly to comparative line graphs, compound line graph is used to subdivide a set of data into two or more sets of data.
