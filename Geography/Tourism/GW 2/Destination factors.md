# Destination factors
## Attractions
An attraction is a feature or quality that makes a place exciting to visit. An example is in Dubai, the UAE (an oil rich country [[Tourism#Tourism is very important]]), where they invested a lot into different attractions such as the Buri Al Arab which is the world's first 7 star hotel and the palm island which was going to be used for entertainment facilities.
## Infrastructure and services
Infrastructure is found everywhere from transport to electrical, communication and water and waste disposal. Singapore is well know for their airport infrastructure which is always expanding the airport. In 2017, construction of terminal 4 was completed to serve up to 85 million people. 
## Access to information
Often confused with [[Ease of access to info]] !! Access to information allows tourist to obtain information in the country easily. Such as language translations on signs for tourist from different language speaking countries.
