# Shortage of services
Shortage of services to the local are due to resource allocation where the government may choose to divert resources to tourist [[Destination factors#Attractions]] instead of the locals to earn more money.
This leads to shortage of power or water to the locals in Bali, Indonesia as the water is used to operate hotels and theme parks.
