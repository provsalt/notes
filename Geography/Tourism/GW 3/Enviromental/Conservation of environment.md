# Conservation of natural environment
Due to revenue collected from tourism from entrance fee to these natural environments such as national parks, these can be used to pay it's staff to maintain and preserve the environment that already exists.

Example in Kenya, Africa, funding from tourists allows to preserve the animals and their habitat as tourist wants to see these animals.
