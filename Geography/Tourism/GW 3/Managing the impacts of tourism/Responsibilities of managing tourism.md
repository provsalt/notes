## Local communities
Local communities refer to the groups of locals that live in the same territory that benefit economically from tourism. 
For example in Java, Indonesia, the government support the villagers of Candirejo  
to set up a cooperative to oversee the community’s tourism-related programmes.  
The villagers discuss and decide on programmes that are developed in the village such s homestays, organic farms and organising local transportation.
By 2004, the village had 22 homestays, 22 ‘andongs’ (horse-drawn carts) and 6 local restaurants compared to 10 homestays, 5 ‘andongs’ and no restaurants in 2002.
This allows the locals in making decisions and increase tourism [[Employment opportunities]] of locals however, it is difficult in obtaining external funding from planning authorities and the locals may not be knowledgeable in managing the impacts of tourism.
## Tourists
Tourists are expected to visit an area without damaging the environment and offending the local population.
In 2007, the tourism sustainability group encouraged tourists to select their holiday based on the conservative effects such as the carbon footpritn
Tourists are able to raise awareness on preserving attractions by word of mouth and provide locals with income opportunities such as tour guides.
However tourist may cause damages to the environment and may cause [[Local heritage and culture#Dilution of local customs and heritage]].
## Planning authorities
Planning authorities are the most important as it is able to allocate space for infrastructure and plan new tourism sites.
For example, the Singapore Tourism Board is responsible for promoting and attracting tourists and responsible for conserving the national heritage such as Chinatown and Kampong Glam.
This allows them to work with other governmental agencies and tap on their resources and develop and maintain infrastructure and attractions to help manage impacts of tourism
However, it is difficult to plan for unforeseen events such as extreme weather and their ideas may oppose local communities and NGOs.
