# Seasonal unemployment
There are certain tourist activities that rely on [[Weather and Climate]], obviously you can't go snowboarding in the summer right?
Due to these favourable climatic conditions, in Sapporo, Japan there is a large volume of tourists which require high amount of workers from December to February. 
However, this changes after those months where the workers are unemployed as no tourist are visiting the location once the winter is over which will affect the economy and there will not be any [[Growth in income]].
