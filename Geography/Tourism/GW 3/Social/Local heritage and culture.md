# Preservation of local customs and heritage
Heritage refers to the tradition beliefs, values and customs of a society while customs refers to traditional behaviours that the particular society does.

Due to tourism, there may be preservation as it benefits locals to enhance their sense of history and build more sense of belonging to their community to earn income and these income generated can be used for repairs and maintenance of cultural heritage.

# Dilution of local customs and heritage
As there are economical incentives for locals to earn income from their customs and heritage, they may commercialize on it and it's identity, culture and values may be lost.
For example, older buildings may be used to host tourist activities such as in Chinatown, buildings are converted into souvenir shops.
