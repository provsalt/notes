# Fluctuation in tourism
Tourist numbers can fluctuate whether if it's an increase or decrease over a period of time.

## Disasters
Natural disasters are one of the reasons for tourist fluctuation due to tourist not being to tour the location after buildings collapsed and infrastructures destroyed. They may also have to risk their life to visit the area.
When the Tohoku earthquake happened in 2011,  tourist arrivals dropped tremendously even though it's the season of the blooming of cherry blossoms when there is a high volume of tourists visiting.
## Diseases
There are times where there are outbreaks of diseases in an area and tourist do not want to risk being infected by the contagious disease.
In 2020, due to COVID-19, tourist stopped travelling as they were advice to not travel by [[Promoting of tourism#International organization]] (specifically World Health Organization) to prevent contracting the virus.
## Recessions
Recessions refers to a period of economical downfall where there are a loss of incomes and jobs. This is less disposable income which causes tourists to travel lesser.
In 2008 during the global financial crisis, there was a collapse of housing market which triggered panic of most financial institutions around the world which caused the economy to slow down.
## Political situation
Political situations are times of conflicts between groups of people that result in a war.
This may cause infrastructure and services to be shut down and be damaged.
Eg: In 2011, Libya had a civil war and most governments discouraged tourist to travel to Libya.
Eg in 2022, Sri Lanka economy has went down by a lot and poor decisions by the government due to not [[Ideas shaping governance#Having good leadership]]. This cause fights and protest to take place in the country and even [[Looting]] for [[Food consumption|Food]].
