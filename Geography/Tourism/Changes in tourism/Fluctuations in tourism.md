# Fluctuation in tourism
Tourist numbers can fluctuate whether if it's an increase or decrease over a period of time.

## Disasters
Natural disasters are one of the reasons for tourist fluctuation due to tourist not being to tour the location after buildings collapsed and infrastructures destroyed. They may also have to risk their life to visit the area.
When the Tohoku earthquake happened,  tourist arrivals dropped tremendously even though it's the season of the blooming of cherry blossoms.
