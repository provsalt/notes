# Development of technology
Development in technology causes travel times to decrease (which decreases the amount of kerosene used in places [[Hydrocarbons]]) and causes cost to decrease for the average person. Better air routes are also formed between countries due to the interconnected world with [[Globalisation]]

This is also caused by the rise of budget airlines like airasia, ryan air etcetera due to their more smaller and more fuel efficient aircrafts.
This increased the short-haul travels.
