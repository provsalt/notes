# Kyoto protocol
The Kyoto protocol was an agreement setup by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate (UNFCCC) with the goal of reducing the levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
### Success
Many countries have met or exceeded the targets set by the Kyoto protocol and some countries continue to keep track of their emissions levels and keeping to their emissions target after the agreement.
### Limitations
There are still countries who did not achieve their emission targets and the agreement was not legally binding and there was no penalties faced for not keeping to the emissions target.
This prompted for a new agreement after 2012 called the Copenhagen protocol.
