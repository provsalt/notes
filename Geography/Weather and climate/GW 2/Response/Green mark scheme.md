# Green Mark Scheme
Green Mark Scheme was launched by the building and construction authority of Singapore in 2005 aims to encourage more 'green' buildings 

#### Success
Buildings that are evaluated are found to have 15 percent to 35% more in energy savings compared to conventional buildings
This energy savings decreases the overall amount of fossil fuel that is required to power the buildings
#### Limitations
To construct such 'green' buildings, the materials necessary may be more expensive and implementing technology such as solar panels may require more money to be spent on construction.
