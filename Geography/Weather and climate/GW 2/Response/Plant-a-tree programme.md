# Plant a tree programme
The plant a tree programme was launched to encourage more trees to be planted by encouraging people to donate money to buy a tree or volunteer in tree planting programmes.
#### Success
The programme has contributed to about 60000 new trees planted annually in Singapore and trees are the green lungs of the earth which removes carbon dioxide and reduces [[Greenhouse effect]].
#### Limitations
Trees take a long time to grow and mature which positive benefits will take time to materialize.
