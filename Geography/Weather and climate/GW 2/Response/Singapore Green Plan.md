# Singapore Green Plan
Singapore green plan was launched in 2002 by the ministry of environment and aims to generate 60% of Singapore's energy through natural gas by 2012.
#### Success
As early as 2010, 79% of Singapore's electricity was generated with natural gas and exceeded the 60% target reducing pollution.
#### Limitation
However natural gas requires complex treatment plants to process and pipelines to transport the natural gas. These pipelines has high maintenance costs because they have to be laid out underground and had to be checked regularly for leakage.
