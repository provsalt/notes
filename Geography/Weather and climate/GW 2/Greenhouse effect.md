# Greenhouse effect
Greenhouse effect is a natural process which is essential to life on earth.
Greenhouse gases trap heat (long wave radiation) that may escape earth which are necessary to sustain life on earth and provides the warmth in the atmosphere.

## Enhanced greenhouse effect
Enhanced greenhouse effect is the increase in concentration of greenhouse gases which is negative as it increases global temperatures.
Human causes have been contributing to enhanced greenhouse effect at a greater rate than any natural emissions.
These Anthropogenic factors include
- [[Deforestation]]
- [[Changing land use]]
- [[Burning of fossil fuels]]
