# Deforestation
Deforestation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gases. (DEADL)
Deforestation occurs when forests are cleared to 
- Make wood which are used for paper and building material.
- Mining of precious ores
- Planting of crops
- Construction of infrastructure

When the green lungs of the earth is cleared, there are less carbon dioxide that can be absorbed by the plants for [[Photosynthesis]]. 
When trees are removed, more soil is also exposed which are high in carbon, This causes the carbon to be [[Oxidised]] when exposed to the sun

2C + O₃ -> CO₃
```
To combat deforestation, many countries have started reforestation and afforestation efforts.
