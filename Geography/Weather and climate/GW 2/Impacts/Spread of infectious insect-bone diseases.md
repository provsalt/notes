# Spread of infectious insect-bone diseases
Due to higher temperature, maximum amount of water vapour in the air increases and hence more rainfall in various parts of the world leading to infectious insect-bone diseases from spreading.

For examples with more heavy rainfall, mosquitoes would be more likely to reproduce which increases the spread of malaria and dengue fever.
This may affect tourism as tourists may not want to be infected. This causes [[Fluctuations in tourism]].
