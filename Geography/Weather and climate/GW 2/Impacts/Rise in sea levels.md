# Rise in sea levels
Rise in sea levels refers to the increase in the mean height of the sea's surface between the high tide and low tide relative to land.
This is because of the melting of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica which results in water being released into the oceans.
Rising sea levels threatens low-lying areas and two-thirds of the worlds largest cities are located in the coastal areas are at risk. This is because humans usually have settlements near water.
