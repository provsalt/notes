# More frequent extreme weather events
Due to climate change, there will be an increase in rarer weather phenomenon that results in significant economical loses and loses of lives.
This is because higher temperatures allows greater amount of water vapour to be in the [[Relative humidity]] which can cause thee extreme weather events.
Examples include heat waves, floods, droughts and tropical cyclones
.
This causes countries to spend more money on infrastructures to prevent floods and cause financial loses for countries with huge agriculture industry as crops may be destroyed. Hence less food for the country and less money from trade by selling food.
