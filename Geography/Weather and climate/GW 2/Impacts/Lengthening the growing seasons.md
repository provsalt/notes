# Lengthening the growing season
Certain regions may experience longer growing seasons due to increase in temperature.
This can cause certain countries to be able to grow certain crops and decrease the harvest time for some crops.
However, certain crops may be affected and average yield may be reduced as they require cooler weather conditions to grow.
