# Natural causes of climate change
## Variation in solar output
The sun has a magnetic activity cycle that lasts about 11 years where the increase of magnetic activity causes solar radiation to be increased
Sunspots are cooler regions on the sun that appear as black spots. These causes the area around the sunspot to radiate more to compensate the cooler temperature of the sunspot.
Sunspot activity is linked to the amount of solar radiation which affects the temperature of earth.
## Volcanic eruptions
Volcanic eruptions affect the climate of earth as they release [[Air pollutants]], dust and ashes when they erupt.  See [[Risks of living near volcanoes#Pollution]] for more info.

These pollutants, ash and dusts will then reflect solar energy back into space resulting in global dimming. This causes the earth to temporarily cool down (global cooling) the earth for months or years. An example is the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano.
