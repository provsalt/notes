# Changing land use
Over the years, there has been changing land use as our population has increased which caused land to be urbanised and designed for people to live in.
## Agriculture
Agriculture use of land has increased as there is a higher population and change in [[Food preference]] in less developed countries which causes [[Deforestation]] to produce crops for food.
These changes in food consumption also increases the need for cattle farming and cattle releases methane as a waste gas as less developed countries shift from cereals to meat consumption.
## Industries
Industries refers to the production of goods and services within a country.
BRIC countries have been contributing to more global carbon dioxide emissions due to their rapid industrialisation caused by [[Globalisation]] where companies sets up manufacturing facilities in these country as it offers cheaper labour. 
## Urbanisation
Urbanisation is the process which an increasing number of people live in urban areas such as cities or towns. This causes [[Burning of fossil fuels]] to provide energy for household activities.
Construction of more infrastructure and manufacturing construction materials release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as well.
