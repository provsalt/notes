# Relative humidity
Relative humidity refers to the ratio of water vapour in the air to the maximum amount of water vapour in the air that can be held in the [[Temperature]]

As **temperature increase, relative humidity decreases**. This is because higher temperature allows the air to hold more water vapour but the amount of water vapour doesn't change.

When relative humidity is at 100%, it is known as the saturation where the dew point is the temperature that causes saturation to occur.
The altitude of dew point is high as it is a [[Factors affecting temperature|Factor affecting temperature]]
At dew point, [[State changes#Condensation G - L]] happens where water vapour (g) changes into water (l) and eventually forms clouds.
