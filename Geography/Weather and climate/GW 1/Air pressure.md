# Air pressure
Air pressure refers to the force exerted on a unit area of the earth's surface by the height of a column of air above it
Air pressure is measured in millibars while measuring it involves a barometer

When land is heated, the air around it is heated as well, causing it to expand and rise. This causes a slight vacuum to be created as there are less air molecules. This area is also know as an area with low pressure. Vice-versa with high pressure when it cools and sinks.
