# Monsoon winds
Monsoon are regional winds which reverse directions seasonally.
Monsoon winds is highly affected by [[Coriolis effect]] which causes directions of winds to change.
## Northeast monsoon (Oct to Feb)
Northeast monsoon occurs as the northern hemisphere experiences winter which causes the air in central Asia to sink due to temperatures being lower. This causes the area to have higher pressure compared to Australia which experiences summer in this time frame which causes air to expand and rise, causing it to have lower pressure. Wind moves from the higher pressure central Asia (northeast of the equator) towards Australia but due to [[Coriolis effect]], the winds become deflected and becomes northeast monsoon which picks up moisture from the Indian ocean and bringing rain to Australia.
## Southwest monsoon (Jun to Sep)
From June to September, Australia experiences winter causing the air to sink causing the air pressure to become high while central Asia experiences summer which causes the air pressure to become lower as temperature is higher and air expand and rises. Wind moves from Australia (southwest of the equator) towards central Asia however due to [[Coriolis effect]], wind is deflected and becomes southwest monsoon which
