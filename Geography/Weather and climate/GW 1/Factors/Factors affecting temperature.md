# Factors affecting temperature (CLAD)
## Cloud cover
Measuring clouds: Look in the atmosphere
#### When there is cloud cover:
In the [[Geography/Weather and climate/GW 1/Factors/Clouds#^hJOdkWcU|day]], the clouds will reflect most of the short wave radiation from the sun out of earth.
However, during the [[Geography/Weather and climate/GW 1/Factors/Clouds#^u9Y7CJ5f|night]], long wave radiation emitted by the earth will be trapped in earth by clouds
Opposite happens when there is [[Geography/Weather and climate/GW 1/Factors/Clouds#^bsavGp2j|no cloud cover]]
## Latitude
Latitude is the distance from any point on earth to the equator measured in degrees eg: 10°N/3°S
#### [[Geography/Weather and climate/GW 1/Factors/Latitude.md#^FORWEnJH|Angle of incidence]]
At lower latitude (near equator) sun rays are more direct and angle of incidence is higher. This causes more energy to be concentrated to a single area instead of being more spread out.
#### [[Geography/Weather and climate/GW 1/Factors/Latitude.md#^yhkBDron|Curvature of the earth]]
At higher latitude, solar energy is lower as most energy will be lost to absorption and reflection from the earth
However at lower latitude, there is less distance that the solar rays have to travel to reach earth's surface, Hence less energy is lost due to reflection, scattering and absorption.
## Altitude
Altitude is the relation between the distance from the sea level to the height of a place
#### Amount of particles
At higher altitudes, air is less dense and there is less [[Air pollutants]] to absorb the short wave radiation emitted by the sun compared to in lower altitude caused by [[Greenhouse effect]].
#### Less long wave radiation
When the altitude is higher, there is lesser land (due to [[#Continental effect]]) that can be heated and emit long wave radiation and heat up the surrounding. Therefore the temperatures are generally lower.
## Distance from sea
#### Maritime effect
Maritime effect affects land that is closer to the sea as sea generally heats up slower than land and sea cools down slower than land which causes the region to have a smaller temperature range in their [[Weather and Climate#Climate|Climate]]
```ad-example
Day (slow to heat): around 25℃
Night (slow to cool): around 20℃
Temperature range: 5℃
```
#### Continental effect
Continental effect affects land that are further from the sea as land heats up faster and cools down faster than sea which causes the region to have a smaller temperature range in their [[Weather and Climate#Climate|Climate]]
```ad-example
Day (fast to heat): around 32℃
Night (fast to cool): around 18℃
Temperature range: 14℃
Hence, cooler winters and hotter summers
