Since it's near the equator, [[Factors affecting temperature#Geography Weather and climate GW 1 Factors Latitude md FORWEnJH Angle of incidence|Angle of incidence]] is direct which affects the temperature and causes a high mean annual temperature of ~ 27℃
There is also low annual temperature range as the equatorial region as it does not experience seasons.
## Tropical monsoon
Tropical monsoon climate is found between 5-25° N/S of the equator eg: India.
Tropical monsoon climate is affected heavily by [[Monsoon]] winds which attributes to it's distinct wet and dry seasons.
It has a high mean annual temperature of ~ 26℃ while having a low annual temperature range of ~6℃
## Cool temperate
Cool temperate climate is found between 45-60° N/S of the equator eg: France.
It has a low mean annual temperature of ~ 10℃ while having a high annual temperature range of ~25℃ as it is affected by the 4 seasons.
