# Precipitation
Precipitation refers to water in any form (snow etc) that falls from the atmosphere.

Precipitation happens when clouds are formed due to [[Coalescence]] and become a mass of water droplets.
These water droplets will eventually fall from the atmosphere and creating rain. 

Measuring rain: Rain gauge
## Convectional rainfall
Often occurs in Singapore. Convectional rain occurs when the earth surface is heated intensely.
This causes the air around it to become unstable and expands and rises to higher altitudes before approaching the dew point to condense and form clouds.
When the water molecules in the clouds becomes large enough, they'd fall to the ground as rain
## Relief rainfall
Relief rain occurs when warm moist air is forced to rise over a land form - usually over a mountain range
As wind brings moist air from the sea to the coast, they are forced up the windward side of the mountain and is forced to cool as there is a high [[Relative humidity]] causing saturation to occur.
This causes clouds to be formed on the windward side of the mountain and rain on the windward side while the leeward side is usually dry as most of the rain would've fall on the windward side of the mountain.
