# Wind
Wind moves from high [[Air pressure]] to an area of lower [[Air pressure]]
Wind speed is measured with a anemometer while wind direction and frequency can be measured with a wind vane and represented in wind roses where most frequent wind blown in a direction is called the prevailing wind. 

### Sea breeze
Sea breeze occurs during the day where the land heats up faster than the sea which causes the air around the land to expand and rise. This causes the land to have a lower pressure compared to the sea causing wind to be generated and air moves from the sea to the land.
### Land breeze
Land breeze happens during the night where the land cools faster than the sea which causes the air in the air to sink and have a higher pressure than the sea.
This causes wind to be generated where the wind moves from the higher pressure land to the lower pressure sea.
