# Plate movement
## Convection current
1. The high temperature of the mantle heats up the magma causing the magma to rise and expand to the surface.
2. This causes the plates to be dragged along and move apart from each other
3. The magma then cools and sink, this causes the plates to be pulled.
4. This will continuously happen due to the magma being warmed again after sinking.

## Slab-pull force (subduction)
1. As the plate subducts, it pulls the rest of the plate along which drives the downward moving portion of convection currents.
