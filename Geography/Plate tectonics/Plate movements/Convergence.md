# Convergence
Convergence occurs when the plate moves towards and collides with each other.
## Oceanic-Oceanic
When oceanic plates converge together, the more dense oceanic plate will subduct and sink under the other oceanic plate due to intense pressure and some of the plate will be heated and melted to become magma overtime at the subduction zone. The subduction zones will form [[Trench|Trenches]]
These magma may flow up the cracks of the ocean floor and form [[Volcanoes]]
## Continental-Continental
When two plates converge against each other [[Fold mountains]] are formed. An example is the Himalayan mountain range where Mount Everest is the tallest fold mountain which is 8850m.
**This type of convergence does not form volcanoes**
## Oceanic-Continental
The oceanic crust is denser than the continental crust because of the basalt which causes the continental crust to sink and subduct due to pressure and melts to become magma. Some of the magma will rise to the earth surface to form [[Volcanoes]]. The compressional force will cause some of the continental crust to become fold mountains. An example is the Andes fold mountain mostly located in Chile.
