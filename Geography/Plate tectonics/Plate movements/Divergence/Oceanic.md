# Oceanic-Oceanic divergence
Since oceanic divergence happens, the plates move apart from each other, opening a hole which will be filled by the magma, allowing for sea floor spreading to happen since it will create basalt.

## Sea floor spreading
1. The plates move apart from each other which creates a gap in the plate boundary.
2. Magma rises up and solidify to fill up the gap and creates new sea floor.
	This will extend the existing sea floor
3. This makes rocks found nearer to the plate boundary younger than the rocks found further away.
4. This results in a creation of a mid-oceanic ridge.
