# Rift valley
Rift valley are formed from [[Convergence|Continental divergence]] where continental plates are pulled apart, generating tensional forces which gives rises to faults and fractures on the crust.

When the section of the crust extend along fault lines, rock layers between the two parallel faults will subside and sink. This gives rise to the rift valley which is the linear depression on the steep sides.

These rift valleys may form seas over a span of thousands of years due to it lengthening and deepening to seas.

## Block mountains
Block mountains are similar to rift valleys, however instead of being the linear depression, it is the block of land that is higher than the surrounding which will classify it as the block mountain.

They are found at divergent plate boundaries and require continental crust.

Eg: East African rift valley. (Somalian plate and Nubian plate) 
	Huff valley of New Zealand (Australia plate and Pacific plate)
