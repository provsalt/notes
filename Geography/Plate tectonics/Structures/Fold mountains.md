# Fold mountains
There are two types of folds, syncline (downfold) and anticline fold (upfold).
Fold mountains are formed along convergent plate boundaries

Continental plates move towards each other and resist subduction and generating compressional forces.
Compressional forces would cause layers of rocks to buckle and fold.

They are more common in areas where there are sedimentary rocks as they are more flexible than other types of rocks. They are formed from multiple rock layers.

Eg: Himalayans mountain (Indian plate and Eurasian plate)
