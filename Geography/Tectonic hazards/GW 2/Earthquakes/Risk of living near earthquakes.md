## Tsunamis
Tsunami refers to an unusually large sea wave. 
Tsunamis can be formed by 
- The movement of sea floor
- Explosive underwater volcano eruption
- [[#Landslides]]
The formation starts with seismic waves from the earthquake that is exerted on the mass of water. Then the tsunami waves starts at a height less than 1m which travels at 800km/h and may pass undetected. When reaching shallower water, the speed of waves slow down due to friction causing the height to rise to up to 15m.
Tsunamis are a threat to low lying coastal areas which sweeps up 
## Landslides
Landslides are caused when the vibrations weaken the slope of hills and mountains causing landslides of soil, rock and stone travelling at high speeds and destroying houses.
## Disruption of services
The disruption of basic services such as the supply of water, electricity and gas  
in the affected area can occur.  
The vibrations from earthquakes can snap pipes and break cables and may cause the outbreak of fires.
## Destruction of property
Earthquakes can destroy homes and cause many people to become homeless. People have to stay at temporary shelters while their homes are being rebuilt as response measures.
## Loss of lives
Living near earthquake zones can caused loss of lives during an earthquake event.
