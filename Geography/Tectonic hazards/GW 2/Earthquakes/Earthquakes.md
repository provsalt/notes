An earthquake is a vibration on the earth's crust caused by sudden released of stored energy in the rocks found along fault lines.
Earthquakes release energy through seismic waves recorded with a seismograph where the focus is the location the energy was released from while the epicentre is the location above the focus.

## Factors for the extent of damage caused by earthquakes
### Population density
In a densely populated area, there may be more damages caused and casualties due to the amount of people living in the area compared to a less dense location.
### Level of preparedness
Level of preparedness is the amount of preparation taken by the authorities and citizens. These preparation can include evacuation plans, training rescue workers and emergency drills.
### Distance from epicentre
A deep-focus earthquake has a lower impact on the land as it has a longer time to travel up the surface and the energy would have already dissipated when reaching the surfacing causing less impact compared to a shallow-focus earthquake.
### Time of occurrence
The time of occurrence of an earthquake affects peopleâ€™s chances of survival in  
the earthquake as it depends on the activities of the people at that time.  
When an earthquake occurs during wee hours, there will likely be more deaths  
as many people are sleeping and may have a higher chance of being trapped in  
the rubble of collapsed houses or buildings.
### Type of soil
Buildings and houses constructed on saturated and unconsolidated soil can  
experience liquefaction caused by an earthquake.  
Liquefaction is a situation when the ground becomes unstable and  
saturated soil flow like a liquid.
