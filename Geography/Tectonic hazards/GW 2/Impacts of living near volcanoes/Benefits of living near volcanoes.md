# Benefits of living near volcanoes
## Fertile soil
Lava and ash from volcanic eruptions breaks down to form fertile soil over time. These minerals allows for plants to grow well without the need of [[Fertilizers and Herbicides]] and earn money.
## Precious materials
Volcanic rocks may contain precious stones and minerals such as diamonds when the rocks are erupted through the volcano and can be made into jewellery and earn money.
## Tourism
Many tourist activities can be done near volcanoes such as hiking or the [[Scenic beauty]] of the mountains and the locals can become tour guides or charge fees to earn money.
## Geothermal energy
Geothermal energy is derived from the heat of the earth's crust where groundwater is heated into steam which drives turbine to produce electricity. In Iceland, over 70 percent of homes are powered by geothermal energy.
