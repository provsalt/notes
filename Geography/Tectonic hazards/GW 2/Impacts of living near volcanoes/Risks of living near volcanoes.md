# Risk of living near volcanoes
## Destruction by volcanic material
### Lava
Lava has a high temperature of between 500 ℃ and 1400 ℃ and burns the area it flows through.
Low silica lava moves rapidly and flow over long distance
### Pyroclastic flow
Pyroclastic flow will destroy ==everything== in it's path with hot rock fragments ranging from ash and boulders travelling at high speeds
Inhaling hot ash and gases can lead to serious injury or deaths. 
### Volcanic bombs
Volcanic bombs of heated rocks can fall into areas surrounding the volcano and cause property damages.
### Land slides
Landslides occur due to the structural collapse of a volcano cone during a volcanic eruption. This leads to the possibilities of obstructing the flow of rivers, causing floods and burry villages and farmlands.

## Pollution
Thick plumes of ash may disrupt economic activities, block sunlight, suffocate crops and cause severe respiratory issues for animals and humans.
Eg: The idk whatever Iceland volcano (2010) which produced a lot of tiny particles of abrasive glass, sand and rock which disrupted air travel causing delays to 1.2 million passengers and cost airlines millions of dollar.
