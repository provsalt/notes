# Rift valley
Rift valley are formed from [[Convergence|Continental divergence]] where continental plates are pulled apart, generating tensional forces which gives rises to faults and fractures on the crust.

When the section of the crust extend along fault lines, rock layers in-between the two parallel faults will subside and sink. This gives rise to the rift valley which is the linear depression on the steep sides while block mountains are the block of land with steep slope standing higher than the surrounding land.

These rift valleys may form seas over a span of thousands of years due to it lengthening and deepening to seas.

Eg: East African rift valley. (Somalian plate and Nubian plate) 
	Huff valley of New Zealand (Australia plate and Pacific plate)
