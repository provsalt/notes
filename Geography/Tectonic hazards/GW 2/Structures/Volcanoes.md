# Volcanoes
A volcano is a landform formed by magma ejected from the mantle onto the earth surface.
Volcanoes can be formed in many ways (check linked mentions)

## Shield volcanoes
Shield volcanoes have low silica lava which makes it flow easily and makes it easy to be spread out. which makes the slopes more flat and gentle compared to stratovolcanoes.

Since it is lower in silica content, it is less explosive and allows for gases to escape easily.
Shield volcanoes are found in divergent plate boundaries
## Stratovolcanoes
Stratovolcanoes have high silica lava which makes it flow slowly which spreads out over a small area. which makes it a cone like structure with a narrow base.

Since it has higher silica content, it is more explosive and traps gases which builds up pressure making the explosion more deadly.
```ad-note
Silica is also known as silicon dioxide (SiO2) which can be found mostly in sand.
