# Internal structure of the earth
Earth internal structure is like an egg. Core is the yolk, mantle as the egg white and the shell as the crust.
## Core

## Mantle

## Crust
### Oceanic crust
Oceanic crust are found in deep oceans, typically around 5 to 10km tick and are denser than continental crust, thus sinking and subducting under the continental crust.

They have heavier and denser rocks called basalt which is formed from magma cooling quickly.
### Continental crust
They are found beneath the earth's continental and masses, around 10-70km deep, contain lighter rocks like granite that has formed from the last few billion years.
