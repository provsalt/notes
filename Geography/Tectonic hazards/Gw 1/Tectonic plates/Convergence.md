# Convergence
Convergence occurs when the plate moves towards and collides with each other.
## Oceanic-Oceanic
When oceanic plates converge together, the denser oceanic plate will subduct and sink under the other oceanic plate due to intense pressure which is called the subduction zone. At the subduction zone, an oceanic trench. The subducted oceanic plate will cause the uppermost mantle to melt and become magma overtime at the subduction zone. 
These magma may flow up the cracks of the ocean floor and form [[Volcanoes]]

## Continental-Continental
When two plates converge against each other [[Fold mountains]] are formed. An example is the Himalayan mountain range where Mount Everest is the tallest fold mountain which is 8850m.

## Oceanic-Continental
The oceanic crust is denser than the continental crust causing the oceanic crust to subduct and sink due to intense pressure. An oceanic trench is also formed at the point of subduction similarly to the [[#Oceanic-Oceanic]] while fold mountains are formed on the continental plate. Magma is melted from the mantle and will rise to the earth surface to form [[Volcanoes]]. An example is the Andes fold mountain mostly located in Chile.
