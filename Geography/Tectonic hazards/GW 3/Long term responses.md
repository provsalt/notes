## Rebuilding of infrastructure
The rebuilding of infrastructure allows for improvements to be made after the earthquake. See [[Infrastructure]]
This ensures that the buildings will be safer and adhere to a higher standard to ensure lesser lives lost.
However reinforced infrastructure is used to protect against earthquakes only. Additional infrastructure may be needed to be built such as seawalls to protect against threats of tsunamis.
## Provision of healthcare
Healthcare is provided to survivors such as long-term counselling due to the lost of loved ones, homes or jobs. This allows problems to be identified and addressed early on. However, restoring the resilience of people may be difficult.
