Emergency drills refers to the steps practiced when an earthquake occurs. For example in Japan, the annual disaster prevention day simulates a high magnitude earthquake that involves everyone. This creates awareness among the population on what has to be done in times of an earthquake, reducing panics. However drills are often conducted based on the most serious earthquake ever recorded and can be inadequate to prepare the locals from higher magnitude earthquakes.
