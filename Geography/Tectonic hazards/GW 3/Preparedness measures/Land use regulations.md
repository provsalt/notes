Land use regulations prevent people from building near unsafe land such as fault lines and low lying areas that may be affected by [[Earthquakes]] and tsunamis.
For example in California USA, land use regulations prevent buildings from being built near the San Andreas fault.
Land use regulation lowers the [[Risk of living near earthquakes]] as buildings are less likely to be damaged from an earthquake impact.
However, it may be costly for the government to purchase land from private owners and they may be reluctant to move out from that area.
