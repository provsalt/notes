Irrigation is the supply of water other than by natural means where water is brought to an area that is unsuitable for farming. This allows the land to become arable and increases the land where agriculture could occur in.
For example, Libya made the Great Man-made river which supplies water to farms in the Sahara desert which was unsuitable for farming.
However, irrigation may cause salination and waterlogging where water irrigated to soil evaporates and salts are left behind and waterlogging occurs when there's too much water concentrated to the soil causing it to be over-saturated
```ad-note
Waterlogging may lead to liquefracture. See [[Risk of living near earthquakes]]
