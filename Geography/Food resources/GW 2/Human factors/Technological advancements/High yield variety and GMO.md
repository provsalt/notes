High yield variety are improved strains of crops through selective cross breeding. For example, wonder rice takes 100 days to grow compared to 120 days for non HYV rice.
This allows for farmers in India to grow and output more rice compared to traditional crops.
However, HYV crops has reduced the diversification of seeds up to 40%
