## Fertilizers
Fertilizers are substances added to soil that provides nutrients to the plant for healthy growth. This is because nutrients in the soil will be naturally depleted after growing crops for a long time on the same land. Thus fertilizers ensures that the plants can grow to their fullest. 
However, fertilizers may lead to eutrophication if the nutrients gets in rivers where the growth of algae is increased due to the nutrients, causing the death of underwater species due to the depletion of oxygen.
## Herbicides and pesticides
Herbicides and pesticides are chemicals that kills insects and other plants to help with crops grow. This ensures that the crops can grow unencumbered and harvests are not eaten by insects, leading to higher yield.
However, the chemicals of herbicides and pesticides may lead to contamination to the groundwater when the soil is overconcentrated with chemicals and seep into groundwater causing groundwater to be unsafe for drinking
