## Civil strive
Civil strive is a situation where a country faces major internal conflicts that may lead to a civil war. This leads to the crops dying due to it being destroyed in the process, decreasing supply of food.
## Poor governance
Poor governance may lead to food shortages due to corruption, policy errors and an inability to implement policies properly.
For example in Sri Lanka, the use of chemical fertilizers were banned to meet the country's target on exporting fully organic food. However, this shortly lead to crop failure as the nutrients were depleted and are unable to grow to it's full potential.
