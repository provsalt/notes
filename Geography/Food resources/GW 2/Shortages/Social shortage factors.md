## Lack of accessibility
Food accessibility refers to how easily accessible food is to residents. Transport facilities such as roads and rail links must be made available for food to reach people who live far away from food sources.
## Inadequate logistics of food distribution and storage
Food distribution is the movement of food from farms to retail outlets. In certain countries, there are physical features such as mountains that prevents the construction of a good transport network as it's too costly. This may lead to insufficient food to meet demands of locals and as such, importing food may be necessary.
## Rapid population growth
The increase of population growth in LDC increases food demand which may not meet food supply.
For example sub-Saharan countries have to increase food production due to the rapid increase of both urban and rural population.
