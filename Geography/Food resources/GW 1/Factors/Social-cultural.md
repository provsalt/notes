# Food consumption - Social-cultural
## Food preferences
People may choose what types of food to consume for example vegetarians do not consume anything other than vegetables.
Developed countries are more likely to prefer organic food compared to genetically modified food because they have more [[Economical#Disposable income]] and are more health conscious. 
## Population growth
Population growth increases the food consumption worldwide as everyone requires food to live.
