# Food consumption - Economical
## Disposable income
When a country has higher [[GDP]] per capita and are able to earn more money, they are able to afford more and better food such as meat as discussed in [[Food consumption patterns]].
## Food prices
Since developed countries earn more [[#Disposable income]], they are not really affected by the food prices as they are able to afford food even when food prices soar. An example is during the food crisis in 2006-2008 causing prices of food to double.
