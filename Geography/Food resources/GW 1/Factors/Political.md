# Food consumption - Political
## Stability of food sources
Stability of food sources may cause variation in food consumption as there are more nutritious food for everyone to eat. It is important that there is enough food sources in events of a disaster or a civil war.
To maintain stability of food, there are different ways such as increasing food production by allocating more land for growing of food.
In Singapore, we import food from other countries to ensure that there is an adequate amount of food to eat and the government also stock piles food to maintain food stability.
## Food safety
Food safety refers to the guidelines in place to ensure that food is safe for consumption and is not infested with foodborne diseases.
[In China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1S4_kTEm-U), there is uncertainty on what ingredients are present in their food. 
In Singapore, food is tested by the Singapore Food Agency to check the contents in the food.
