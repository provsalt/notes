# Food preference
Food preferences varies from person to person it mainly depends on the country's [[Human development index]]. This indicates if they're able to consume more food and may affect the types of food that they eat (mostly due to disposable income).

In LDCs, there will be high cereal consumption as they account for a huge amount of calorie intake. There will be lesser meat, fruits and vegetables consumption as they are more expensive to purchase and less developed countries usually have lower [[GDP]] per capita. Hence, not everyone in LDC will be able to afford.

In DCs, there is moderate amount of cereal consumption and higher meat consumption compared to LDCs. This is because they have a higher income which allows them to buy meat. However, there has been a decrease of red meat consumption and an increase in fruits and vegetables consumption due to people being more health conscious.
