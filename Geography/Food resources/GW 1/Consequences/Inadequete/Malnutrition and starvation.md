# Malnutrition and starvation
When there is less food, there may be lack of some nutrition to stay healthy such as vitamins which may lead to malnutrition. This enhances when the people are starving as there is inadequate food consumption where it will lead to starvation.

```ad-note
A person is starving when they consume less than 1000 kcal a day. (extreme hunger)

Malnutrition leads to a weakened immune system which is the underlying cause of child deaths associated with diarrhoea and malaria.
This causes them to fall sick easily which [[00 Secondary school/Geography/Food resources/GW 1/Consequences/Inadequete/Economical impacts#Decrease in productivity|Decreases their productivity]] and requires more money spent on healthcare either by the government or by the person. See [[Healthcare approaches]].

Malnutrition and starvation occurs in DCs too, Just not as common.
