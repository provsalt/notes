# Economical impacts of inadequate food consumption
## Decrease in productivity
When people fall sick more easily due to health issues, they will be less productive as they do not work as much as if they weren't sick and are able to be more educated. 
## Increase strain on the economy
In Issue 2 in social studies, there was a discussion of which [[Healthcare approaches]] is the best. If the healthcare was fully subsidised by the government in a LDC, it will put more strain on the economy as the money will go towards healthcare and not to other sectors that will benefit more. 
## Increase long term debts
In the African continent, the countries are more likely to apply for food aid and loans to help with their inadequate food problem. However, this will increase the amount of loans that they have to take up to feed the people to prevent [[Social unrest]]. because the citizens will think the government is incapable. These slowly increase the loans and may risk the country defaulting on their loans and being unable to get more aid in the future.
