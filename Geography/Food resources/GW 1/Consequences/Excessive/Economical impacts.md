# Economical impacts of excessive food consumption
## Decrease in productivity
When people fall sick more easily due to health issues such as [[Obesity]], [[Coronary heart disease]] and diabetes,  they will be less productive as they do not work as much as if they weren't sick and are able to be more educated. 
## Higher healthcare expenditure
In Issue 2 in social studies, there was a discussion of which [[Healthcare approaches]] is the best. If the healthcare was fully subsidised by the government in a DC, the government has to channel more funds to ensure everyone is healthy. This decreases the funds that can be used for other economical development.
