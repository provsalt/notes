# Root hair cells
Root hair cells plays a big part in the transportation of water and mineral ions through osmosis and diffusion up the [[Xylem]] vessels to all parts of the plant.
## Structure of root hair cells
The root hair cells have a long and narrow protrusion which increases the surface area to volume ratio. It also contains many mitochondria as large amount of energy is required for active transport of mineral salts (ions). The root hair cells also contain a large central vacuole which contains sugars and amino acids to reduce the water potential making the water concentration gradient steeper, increasing rate of osmosis.
