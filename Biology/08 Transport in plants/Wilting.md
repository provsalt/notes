# Wilting
Wilting occurs when the plant rate of water loss exceeds rate of water absorption. This prompts the plants to lower [[Transpiration]] to preserve the plants turgidity and stay upright. 
However wilting may not be ideal in some situations as it decreases the intake of carbon dioxide, causing it to become a limiting factor and leaves will fold up decreasing the surface area that is exposed to the sun and reducing photosynthesis.
