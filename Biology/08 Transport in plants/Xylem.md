# Xylem
Xylem vessels transports water and dissolved mineral ions from the [[Root hair cell]] to the mesophyll cells.
Unlike [[Phloem]], xylem cells are dead that are fused together to form the long hollow tube.

## Structure of the xylem
The empty lumen does not contain protoplasm which reduces resistance when water travel up the xylem via [[Transpiration#Transpiration pull]]
The walls are thicken by lignin which provides mechanical support for the plant and prevent the xylem vessels from collapsing
