# Transpiration
Transpiration is the process where water vapour is loss through the aerial parts of a plant such as the stomata
## Transpiration pull
Transpiration pull occurs when the spongy mesophyll cells form thin film of moisture to allow diffusion to occur quicker. This thin film of moisture is then evapourated in the intercellular air space which will [[Diffusion and osmosis|Diffuse]] out through the stomata and cause more water to be used to form thin film of moisture around the spongy mesophyll cells. This then lowers the water potential of spongy mesophyll cells causing osmosis to occur between the cells and the xylem vessels. This suction of water up the xylem vessel is also know as transpiration pull force.

## Factors affecting transpiration
### Humidity
In more humid environment, there is a lower concentration gradient of water vapour concentration outside the leaf compared to the intercellular air space in the leaf. Hence [[Diffusion and osmosis|Diffusion]] of water vapour will be slower and less water will be lost.
### Sunlight
When there is more sunlight, guard cells which photosynthesize will shrink because of more glucose concentration from photosynthesis causing osmosis to occur increasing the cell water potential. Hence stomata size will become wider and more transpiration occurs.
```ad-danger
DO NOT FALL IN THE TRAP THINKING PHOTOSTNTHESIS CAUSES MORE WATER TO BE USED!!! WHILE THAT'S TRUE, **TRANSPIRATION IS THE RATE OF WATER LOST THROUGH THE STOMATA.**
```
### Temperature
Temperature increases the rate of evapouration from the thin film of moisture created by the spongy mesophyll cells. Hence more water will be lost.
### Wind
Similarly to [[#Humidity]], [[Wind]] causes the water vapour concentration outside the leaf to be maintained at a lower concentration as the moisture is being blown away. As a result, there will be a steep concentration, increasing rate of transpiration.
