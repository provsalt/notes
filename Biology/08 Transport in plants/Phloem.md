# Phloem
## Translocation
Translocation is the process of transporting sucrose and amino acids that are produced from [[Photosynthesis]] to the rest of the plant through the phloem. The sucrose and amino acids can travel both up and down as it is bidirectional.
## Structure of the phloem
### Sieve tubes
Sieve tubes do not contain any nucleus to allow substances to move faster as there is less resistance. It also contains sieve plates which has tiny pores that allow rapid flow of food substances. 
## Companion cells
Companion cells supply the sieve tubes with nutrients as the sieve tubes lack most organelles such as nucleus which controls the cell activity.
They also contain many mitochondria to release energy for loading of sugars from the mesophyll cells onto the sieve tube cells by active transport.
