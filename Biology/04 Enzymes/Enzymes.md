# What are enzymes
Enzymes are biological catalyst which speeds up rate of chemical reaction while remaining chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.

There are two types of directions an enzyme.
1. Anabolic reaction (Not so important)
	Substrates built up by enzyme and form a new product.
2. Catabolic reaction
	Substrate broken up by enzyme and formed 2 different products

## Identifying enzymes
Enzymes are highly specialized for reactions they catalyse, that's why different enzymes are required for different specific reactions.

Enzymes mostly ends with ==ase==
Eg: Maltase. which is an enzyme that is acted on [[Nutrients#Carbohydrates|Maltose]]
	Lipase which acts on Lipid
