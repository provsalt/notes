# Factors affecting enzyme rate
Use the [[Lock and key hypothesis]] when answering to help structure your answer.
## Temperature
- Most enzymes are inactive at low temperatures and when temperatures are high, the enzymes may denature as the enzyme could not fit with the substrate anymore.
- As temperature increases, there is more kinetic energy due to the [[Three state on matter]]. This allows the enzyme to form enzyme-substrate complex faster.
- The optimal temperature is where the enzyme is the most active, while above the optimal temperature the rate will slow down as the enzyme loses it's shape and can not form enzyme-substrate complex as fast as it used to. Hence active site is destroyed and substrate cannot be acted on due to the specific nature of enzymes.

## pH
- Different enzymes have different optimal pH and pH range. Some enzyme may only be active at acidic pH while some are active in alkaline pH.
- The pH changes the shape of the enzyme and therefore the substrate cannot fit into the enzyme as it is no longer complementary causing the enzyme is denatured.
