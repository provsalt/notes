# Heart
The heart consist of 4 parts
- Right atrium and right ventricle 
- Left atrium and left ventricle 
	- Left atrium has thicker muscle as it needs more muscle to pump blood at a higher pressure at a longer distance through the aorta

The heart also contains a septum to separate the left side of the heart and the right side of the heart to prevent oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood from mixing together.

Arteries carries blood away from the heart while veins transport blood towards the heart.
