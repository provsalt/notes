# Animal cells
#Biology
## Protoplasm
#### Cytoplasm
- Contains Mitochondria and ribosomes
- Site where most activity occurs

#### Nucleus
- Controls cell activity such as cell growth and cell division.
- Contains DNA that stores DNA information

#### Cell membrane / Plasma membrane
It is partially permeable which allows some substances to pass through
Some examples include:
- Water / Mineral salts
- Oxygen
- Glucose
Via either diffusion or osmosis

## Vacuole
Compared to [[Plant cells#Large central vacuole]], animal cells have small temporary vacuole that stores water and nutrients.

## Mitochondria
[[Respiration]] occurs in the mitochondria where glucose is oxidised to release energy used to perform cell activities such as growth and reproduction

## Ribosomes
Synthesise protein in the cell
For example:
- Enzymes
- Antibodies
- Hormones
