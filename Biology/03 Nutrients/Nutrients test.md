# Iodine test
1. Firstly place leaf in boiling water to remove waxy cuticle found on the leaf
2. Remove leaf from boiling water and add alcohol to remove epidermis cell protecting the lead
3. Wash leaf to remove excess alcohol
4. Add 2cm² of the leaf into a test tube
5. Add a few drops of iodine solution onto the leaf in the test tube

## If start is present
Iodine solution turns from brown to blue-black

## If start is not present
Iodine solution will remain brown

# Ethanol emulsion test
1. Add 2cm² of Benedict's solution to 2cm² of food sample in a test tube
2. Shake the mixture
3. Heat the contents in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes
## If reducing sugar is present
- A white emulation will be formed

## If reducing sugar is not present
- Solution will remain **clear**

# Biuret emulsion test
1. Add 2cm² of sodium hydroxide solution to 2cm² of food sample in a test tube
2. Shake the mixture
3. Add 1% copper(II) sulfate solution drop by drop, shaking the mixture after each drop

## If protein is present
- The solution turn blue to violet

## If protein is not present
- Solution will remain **blue**

# Benedict test
Reducing sugar includes (Glucose and maltose) Not reducing sugars (Sucrose/Starch)

1. Add 2cm² of Ethanol solution to 2cm² of food sample in a test tube
2. Shake the mixture
3. Heat the contents in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes
## If reducing sugar is present
- Low amount: Green precipitate formed
- Moderate amount: Yellow  precipitate formed
- High amount: Brick red precipitate formed

## If reducing sugar is not present
- Solution will remain blue in colour
