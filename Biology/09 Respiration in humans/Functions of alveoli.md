# Alveoli
Alveoli is the site for gaseous exchange between the lungs and the heart due to the double circulatory system.

## Structure of alveoli
1. One cell thick alveoli wall
	- Allows for faster diffusion due to shorter distance
2. Thin film of moisture in alveolus wall
	- Allows for oxygen to dissolve and diffuse through the alveoli easily
