# [[Enzymes]] found in digestion
## Mouth
Produces salivary amylase from the salivary glands which acts on starch and produces maltose.
The optimal pH is pH7 for salivary amylase
## Stomach
Produces pepsin which acts on protein to break it into polypeptides.
The optimal pH for pepsin is pH2
## Pancreas
Pancreatic acid contains trypsin, pancreatic amylase and pancreatic lipase
Trypsin will break down polypeptides into amino acids
Pancreatic amylase will break down starch into maltose
Pancreatic lipase will break fats into fatty acids and glycerol to be absorbed by the small intestine. (not to be confused with bile which emulsifies fat and is produced by the liver)
