# Liver
The liver has many functions. One of them is supplying enough glucose and amino acids. The glucose level is controlled by hormones such as glucagon and insulin.
- The liver also detoxifies alcohol to ensure that the substance is not harmful to the body
- The liver deaminates excess amino acids into urea which will be removed through urine. Some excess amino acids will form glucose or glycogen.
- The liver produces bile which emulsifies fats. Produced bile is stored in the gall bladder.
- The liver stores glycogen from excess glucose to be used when there's not enough glucose.
