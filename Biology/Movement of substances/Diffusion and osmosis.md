# Diffusion
___

#### Definition
Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration down a concentration gradient till equilibrium is reached. ^fd43fa

#### Examples
- Perfume from higher concentration to the room (lower concentration)
- Oxygen and Carbon dioxide diffusing through alveoli to blood ([[Aerobic respiration]])
- Diffusion of glucose into the small intestine from villus
**Diffusion can also occur with a partially permeable membrane!**

#### increasing rate of diffusion
##### Concentration gradient
Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration in **two different region**
The steeper the concentration gradient the faster the rate of diffusion

This is why we can smell the perfume across the room as the particles are traveling to the area with lower concentration from the place it is sprayed (higher concentration).

##### State of particles
| State                     | Solid | Liquid | Gas  |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
| Relative amount of energy | low   | medium | high |
| Speed of diffusion        | slow  | medium | fast | 

Having more energy allows particles to spread out randomly at a higher speed

##### Temperature
Higher temperature will increase kinetic energy which will increase the particles movement speed


# Osmosis
---

#### Definition
Osmosis is the net movement of **water molecules** from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential through  a **partially permeable membrane** (cell membrane) till equilibrium is reached. 

Similarly to [[#Diffusion]], Osmosis instead is the movement of **only water molecules**

#### Examples
___

##### Visking tubing
Visking tubing is partially permeable which allows some water molecules to move from a higher region of water potential (outside visking tubing) to a lower water potential (inside visking tubing which has 5% sugar solution)

##### Potato with LWP

Water has 5% higher water potential than potato cell, hence osmosis will occur and water will travel inwards the cell sap through the cell membrane which is partially permeable.. This will make the cell sap turgid as there are more water than the cell can handle

If this happened in the animal cell, since there is no cell wall, the cell will burst.
