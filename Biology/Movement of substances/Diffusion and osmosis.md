# Diffusion
___

#### Definition
Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a higher concentration to an area of lower concentration down a concentration gradient till equilibrium is reached.

#### Examples
- Perfume from higher concentration to the room (lower concentration)
- Oxygen and Carbon dioxide diffusing through alveoli to blood
- Diffusion of glucose into the small intestine
===Diffusion can also occur with a partially permeable membrane!===

This is why we can smell the perfume across the room as the particles are traveling to the area with lower concentration from the place it is sprayed (higher concentration).

# Osmosis
---

#### Definition
Osmosis is the net movement of ==water molecules== from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential through  a ==partially permeable membrane== (cell membrane) till equilibrium is reached. 

Similarly to [[#Diffusion]], Osmosis instead is the movement of ==only water molecules==

#### Examples
___

##### Potato with LWP

Water has 5% higher water potential than potato cell, hence osmosis will occur and water will travel inwards the cell sap through the cell membrane which is partially permeable.. This will make the cell sap turgid as there are more water than the cell can handle

If this happened in the animal cell, since there is no cell wall, the cell will burst.
