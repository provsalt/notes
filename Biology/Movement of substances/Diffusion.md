# Diffusion
___

#### Definition
Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a higher concentration to an area of lower concentration down a concentration gradient till equilibrium is reached.

#### Examples
- Perfume from higher concentration to the room (lower concentration)
- Oxygen and Carbon dioxide diffusing through alveoli to blood
- Diffusion of glucose into the small intestine
===Diffusion can also occur with a partially permeable membrane!===

This is why we can smell the perfume across the room as the particles are traveling to the area with lower concentration from the place it is sprayed (higher concentration).
