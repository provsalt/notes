# Nutrients
#Biology 
Nutrients are chemical substances in food that provides energy and materials needed by the body
They are all organic compounds something like methane in [[Organic Chemistry]].

These includes
1. Carbohydrates
2. Fats
3. Proteins
4. Vitamins
5. Minerals
6. Water

Some of these nutrients can be tested with [[Nutrients test]]

## Carbohydrates
- Monosaccharides
	Glucose (C6H12O6), Fructose and Galactose
- Disaccharides
	Sucrose, Lactose and Maltose (2 glucose)
- Polysaccharides
	Glycogen, Starch and Cellulose (cell wall)
	- Glycogen is a storage form of carbohydrate in humans
	- Starch is a storage form of carbohydrates in plants

Carbohydrates are important because:
- It provides energy through [[Respiration]]
- It can be converted to fats/protein via [[Organic Chemistry]]

## Fats
Fats are organic compounds which are made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen where it contains lesser hydrogen

### Examples
Fats are used for the following
- Long term energy storage
- Insulating material to prevent heat loss
- Major component of the cell membrane
- Act as a solvent for fat-soluble vitamins

## Protein
There are three stages of protein
1. Amino acids
	The basics of a protein. There are 20 different types of amino acids
2. Polypeptides (shorter protein chain) ... not really important
	They are amino acids joined together to form a long chain
3. Proteins
	Proteins are formed when 2 or more polypeptides are folded together to form a 3D molecule

Proteins are used for growth and repair of worn out [[Cells]] and synthesis new protoplasm for cell division
