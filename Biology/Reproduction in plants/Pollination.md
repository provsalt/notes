# Pollination
Pollination is the process of transfer of male gametes carrying pollen grains to the female stigma
## Cross pollination
Cross pollination is where pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of another flower of the same species.
Cross pollination involves the fusion of gametes where the genetic variation is larger as there are different parents
## Self pollination
Self pollination is where pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower of the same plant.
Self pollination involves the fusion of gametes where the genetic variation is limited as there is only one parent.
