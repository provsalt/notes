# Circulatory system
There needs to be a circulatory system for humans as we will need to transport [[Blood#Red blood cells|Red blood cells]] around the body as we are not a unicellular organism. The red blood cells will transport [[Nutrients]], carbon dioxide, water and oxygen while the white blood cells will protect the body from infections and clotting agents to stop bleeding.

## Double circulatory system
#### Pulmonary circulation
The pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart.
==How to remember: P is before S so breathing first, hence pulmonary first.==

#### Systematic circulation
Systematic circulation carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body and deoxygenated blood from the rest of the body to the heart
