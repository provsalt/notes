# Artery
Arteries transport oxygenated blood away from the heart

They have thick muscular wall to **withstand high pressure** from blood coming from the heart, hence it needs a thick muscular wall to prevent it from bursting with a small lumen.

Blood flows in pulses like heart beats.

#### COMMON ARTERIES
- Pulmonary artery (transport blood away from the heart to the lungs)
- aorta (transport blood away from the heart to the rest of the body)
