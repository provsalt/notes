# Veins
Veins transport deoxygenated blood back to the heart except for pulmonary vein which transport oxygenated blood to the heart.

They contain thin walls with a **bigger lumen** which allows the blood to flow easily and blood flows slowly with low pressure which **does not require large muscles**.  It also have valves to prevent the back flow of blood.
