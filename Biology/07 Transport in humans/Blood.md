# Blood
The blood is made up of [[#Red blood cells]] , white blood cells, platelets and the blood plasma
The blood transports substances around the body such as oxygen, hormones, nutrients and waste products.
## Plasma
The blood plasma contains mostly water, insoluble salts and glucose. It also contains waste products such as urea excreted by the [[Liver]].
## Red blood cells
![[rbc.jpg|300]]
- Contains haemoglobin to carry oxygen for respiration
-  **It is circular and has a biconcave shape
	Increases surface area to volume ratio to absorb and release oxygen faster**
- Does not contain nucleus
	Allows RBC to carry more haemoglobin -> more oxygen
- **Elastic and can turn into a bell shape
	This ensures it can squeeze through the small blood vessels during transport**
	
## White blood cells
White blood cells are larger than red blood cells because the phagocytes have to be big enough to engulf and digest bacteria. 

Lymphocytes will produce antibodies which will help produce neutralise harmful toxins produces by bacteria..

## Platelets (thrombocytes)
When a blood vessel is injured, platelets release thrombokinase which converts prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of Ca2+. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrin threads clot the blood to prevent blood loss.
