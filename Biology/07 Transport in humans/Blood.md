# Blood
**The blood is made up of [[Specialised cells#Red blood cells|Red blood cells]] , white blood cells, platelets and the blood plasma**
 The blood transports substances around the body such as oxygen, hormones, nutrients and waste products.

## Plasma
The blood plasma contains mostly water, insoluble salts and glucose. It also contains waste products such as urea excreted by the [[Liver]].


## Red blood cells

## White blood cells
White blood cells are larger than red blood cells because the phagocytes have to be big enough to engulf and digest bacteria. 

Lymphocytes will produce antibodies which will help produce neutralise harmful toxins produces by bacteria..

## Platelets
Platelets **do not contain nucleus at all**
When a blood vessel is injured, platelets release thrombokinase which converts prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of Ca2+. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrin threads clot the blood to prevent blood loss.
