# Effects of osmosis
## Animal cell
When surrounding solution has high water potential than the cell cytoplasm, water molecules from a higher region of water potential (surrounding solution) moves into the cell cytoplasm with lower water potential. This causes the cell to expand and eventually bursting
When surrounding solution has lower water potential than the cell cytoplasm, water molecules from a higher region of water potential (cell cytoplasm) moves into the surrounding solution with lower water potential. This causes the cell to shrink and become cremated.
## Plant cell
When surrounding solution has high water potential than the cell sap, water molecules from a higher region of water potential (surrounding solution) moves into the cell sap with lower water potential. This causes the cell to expand and become turgid. However, unlike [[Animal cells]], the cell wall will prevent cell from bursting.
When surrounding solution has lower water potential than the cell sap, water molecules from a higher region of water potential (cell sap) moves into the surrounding solution with lower water potential. The cell will become flaccid which causes the the cell membrane and cell cytoplasm to pull away from the cell wall and becomes plasmolysed .
