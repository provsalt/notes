# Pollination
Pollination is the process of transfer of male gametes carrying pollen grains to the female stigma
## Types of pollination
### Cross pollination
Cross pollination is where pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of another flower of the same species.
Cross pollination involves the fusion of gametes where the genetic variation is larger as there are different parents
### Self pollination
Self pollination is where pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower of the same plant.
Self pollination involves the fusion of gametes where the genetic variation is limited as there is only "one parent".

## Insect pollination
Firstly, the Insect lands on standard petal and follows the nectar guides into the flower
After entering the flower, the Insect forces its way in between the two wing petals to collect nectar while collecting nectar, stigma and anthers are exposed. Stigma and anthers brushes against the hairy back of the insect
The pollen grains stick onto the hairs on the insect and at the same time, pollen grains from the previous flower which are stuck on the insectâ€™s back are transferred to the stigma
## Wind pollination
Mature stamens have long filaments that hang downwards and are pendulous
When the anthers are exposed to the wind, the dust-like pollen is shaken free and dispersed by the wind
The large feathery stigmas have large surface areas to trap pollen carried by wind and are able to be pollinated when the pollen lands on the protruding stigma
Wind pollinated flowers tend to have lots of pollens that are small and lightweight to be carried by wind over long distances
