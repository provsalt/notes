# Fertilisation:
Fertilisation is the fusion of nuclei of the male and female gametes to form a zygote.

## Process of fertilisation
1. After pollination, the pollen grain germinates when in
contact with the sugary fluid (provides energy) in the matured stigma.
2. A pollen tube grows out from each pollen grain and the male
gametes enter the pollen tube.
3. As the pollen tube grows, it secrete [[Enzymes]] to digest the
tissues of stigma and style for the pollen tube to penetrate through which eventually reaches the ovary.
4. The pollen tube enters the ovule through the micropyle. The
pollen tube burst, releasing the two male gametes.
5. One of the nucleus of the male gamete fuses with the nucleus
of the female gametes to form a zygote, creating the seeds and the other develops into an embryo. This causes double fertilisation
