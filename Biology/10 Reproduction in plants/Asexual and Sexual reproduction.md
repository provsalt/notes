# Asexual reproduction
Asexual reproduction is the process resulting in the production of genetically identical offspring from one parent, without the fusion of gametes.
This makes asexual reproduction faster as there are no fusion of gametes and pollination doesn't have to take place.
However, this may cause them unable to adapt to changes to environment. For example [[Greenhouse effect]] where climate changes however conditions for growing does not change. This may cause [[Food shortages]] in LDCs.
# Sexual reproduction
Sexual reproduction is the process involving the fusion of two gametes to form a zygote. The zygote will be genetically dissimilar and may inherit traits from both parents which causes it to be able to adapt to the environment easier. This is commercialized by selective breeding for food to achieve [[High yield variety and GMO]]  
However, this method of reproduction is slower as it requires [[Pollination]] and [[Fertilisation]]
