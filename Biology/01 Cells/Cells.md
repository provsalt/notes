# Cells
Cells are the basic unit of life where all organism contain at least one cell or more (single cell organisms will only have one cell eg: bacteria)
Most cells contains protoplasm
Cells are very tiny and microscopes are used when examining cells

There are two main types of cells. Animal cells and Plant cells

## Protoplasm
### Cytoplasm
- Contains Mitochondria and ribosomes
- Site where most activity occurs
### Nucleus
- Controls cell activity such as cell growth and cell division.
- Contains DNA that stores DNA information
### Cell membrane / Plasma membrane
It is partially permeable which allows some substances to pass through
Some examples include:
- Water / Mineral salts
- Oxygen
- Glucose
Via either diffusion or osmosis
## Vacuole
Plant cells contain large vacuoles while animal cells contain small temporary vacuole that stores water and nutrients.
## Mitochondria
[[Respiration#Aerobic respiration]] occurs in the mitochondria where glucose is oxidised to release energy used to perform cell activities such as growth and reproduction
## Ribosomes
Synthesise protein in the cell
For example:
- Enzymes
- Antibodies
- Hormones
### Cell wall
Provides the plant it's fixed shape
Protects the cell from injury
### Chloroplast
Contains many green pigment also known as chlorophyll which allows it to photosynthesis
