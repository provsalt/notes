# Types of specialise cells
## Red blood cells
![[rbc.jpg|300]]
- Contains haemoglobin to carry oxygen for respiration
-  **It is circular and has a biconcave shape
	Increases surface area to volume ratio to absorb and release oxygen faster**
- Does not contain nucleus
	Allows RBC to carry more haemoglobin -> more oxygen
- **Elastic and can turn into a bell shape
	This ensures it can squeeze through the small blood vessels during transport**
	
## Xylem vessel
- Empty lumen without protoplasm which reduces resistance when water travel up the xylem through transpiration pull. More info:  [[Transport in plants.pdf]]
- Walls are thicken by lignin
	Provides mechanical support for the plant

## Root hair cell
- Numerous root hair cell
	Absorb more water faster
- **Long and narrow protrusion
	Increases surface area to volume ratio**
- **Contains many mitochondria
	Needs to respirate a lot of energy as active transport of mineral salts (ions) takes a lot of energy**
