# Plants cells
## Protoplasm
#### Cytoplasm
- Contains Mitochondria and ribosomes
- Site where most activity occurs
#### Nucleus
- Controls cell activity such as cell growth and cell division.
- Contains DNA that stores DNA information
#### Cell membrane / Plasma membrane
It is partially permeable which allows some substances to pass through
Some examples include:
- Water / Mineral salts
- Oxygen
- Glucose
Via either diffusion or osmosis
## Cell wall
Provides the plant it's fixed shape
Protects the cell from injury

## Chloroplast
Contains many green pigment also known as chlorophyll which allows it to photosynthesis

## Large central vacuole
Large central vacuole contains cell sap which contains
- Sugars
- Mineral salts
- Amino acids

## Mitochondria
[[Respiration]] occurs in the mitochondria where glucose is oxidised to release energy used to perform cell activities such as growth and reproduction

## Ribosomes
Synthesise protein in the cell
