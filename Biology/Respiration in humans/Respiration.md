# Respiration
## Aerobic respiration
Aerobic respiration is the process of converting oxygen and glucose to large amounts of energy.

==Glucose + Oxygen -> Large amount of energy + carbon dioxide + water==

## Anaerobic respiration
Anaerobic respiration is the process of converting glucose to small amounts of energy without requiring oxygen.

Anaerobic respiration happens when there is lack of oxygen however energy is still required. Thus there has to be sacrifices made to obtain energy.

==Glucose -> Small amount of energy + lactic acid==
