# Respiration
## Aerobic respiration
Aerobic respiration is the process of breaking down of glucose to large amounts of energy in the presence of oxygen and takes place in [[Animal cells#Mitochondria|Mitochondria]] .

Word equation:
==Glucose + Oxygen -> Large amount of energy + carbon dioxide + water==

## Anaerobic respiration
Anaerobic respiration is the process of converting glucose to small amounts of energy in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration happens in the [[Animal cells#Cytoplasm|Cytoplasm]] compared to mitochondria in aerobic respiration.

Therefore when a person does not have enough oxygen, anaerobic respiration takes place in the muscle cells to release energy.
Therefore muscle cells will feel sore due to lactic acid being produced in the muscles.

Word equation:
==Glucose -> Small amount of energy + lactic acid==
