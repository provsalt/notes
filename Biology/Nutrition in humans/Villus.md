# Villus
Villus are located near the ileum where they absorb [[Nutrients]] through a partially permeable membrane.
Villus are finger like projections which increases the surface area to volume ratio. They include microvilli in the villi.  There is tons of microvillus to maintain the concentration gradient for fast absorption 

The villus is one cell thick which allows nutrients to be absorbed faster.

The villus includes a blood capillary which transports amino acids and glucose while the lacteal capillary transports fats to the body.
