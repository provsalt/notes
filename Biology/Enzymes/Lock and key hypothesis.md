# Lock and key hypothesis
The enzyme is the lock and the substrate is the key.

The substrate binds to the enzyme at the active site as the enzyme and the substrate are complementary shapes like a key to a lock to form an enzyme-substrate complex. Upon reaction. products are formed and they leave the enzyme leaving it chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.
