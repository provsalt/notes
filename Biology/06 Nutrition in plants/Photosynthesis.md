# Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy into chemical potential energy in the form of glucose before storing as Starch, a form of [[Nutrients#Carbohydrates]]
Equations:
Carbon dioxide + Water Sunlight/Chlorophyll -> Glucose + Oxygen
6CO₂ + 6 H₂O -> C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂
Rate of photosynthesis can be affect by different factors. See: [[Photosynthesis]].

## Products of photosynthesis
When photosynthesis is conducted, glucose and oxygen is produced. 
### Glucose
Glucose is used immediately for [[Respiration]] Most of the glucose will be converted into sucrose for translocation to occur.
Some glucose will be converted into amino acids in the presence of nitrate mineral salts from [[Root hair cell]] and excess glucose is converted to starch.
### Oxygen
Oxygen is used immediately for [[Respiration#Aerobic respiration]]. Excess oxygen diffuses out of the plant through the aerial parts like the stomata.  

# Factors affecting photosynthesis
## Light intensity and Carbon dioxide concentration
As light intensity/CO2 increases, rate of photosynthesis increases as there are more input causing more outputs to form
## Temperature
As temperature increases, [[Enzymes]] reactions increases, causing more enzyme-substrate complex to be formed which increases the rate of photosynthesis.
