# Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy into chemical potential energy in the form of glucose before storing as Starch, a form of [[Nutrients#Carbohydrates]]
Equations:
Carbon dioxide + Water Sunlight/Chlorophyll -> Glucose + Oxygen
6CO₂ + 6 H₂O -> C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂

Rate of photosynthesis can be affect by different factors. See: [[Factors affecting photosynthesis]].

## Products of photosynthesis
When photosynthesis is conducted, glucose and oxygen is produced. 
### Glucose
Glucose is Used immediately for cellular [[Respiration]]
