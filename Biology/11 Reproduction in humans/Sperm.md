# Sperm
Sperm aka spermatozoa are made up of three parts, the head, middle pieces and the tail.

- Head
	- Contains nucleus which carries the set of 23 chromosomes in the DNA
	- Acrosomes is an [[Enzymes]] which breaks down the egg membrane during fertilization so the sperm can penetrate the egg
- Middle piece
	Has numerous mitochondria to release energy for sperms to swim towards the egg
- Tail (flagellum)
	Enables the sperm to swim towards the egg
