# Ovum
Ovum also known as egg is produced in the ovaries when the level of oestrogen in the [[Menstrual cycle]] is high or the ovulation period.

The ovum is fertilized in the oviduct as the cilia sweeps the egg from the ovary so the [[Sperm]] does not have to travel too far as it may not have enough energy to travel all the way to the ovary.

The ovum dissolves in about 2 days after being released and the sperm is no longer able to fertilize the egg.
