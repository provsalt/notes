# Menstrual cycle
The menstrual cycle usually lasts 28 days. It depends from person to person as there are factors that can affect the duration of the cycle. These include:
- [[Malnutrition and starvation|Malnutrition]]
- Illness
- Stress
Oestrogen and progesterone hormones affect the cycle the most where oestrogen is used for the growth and repair of the uterine lining after [[#Menstruation 1-5]] and the release of [[Ovum]] during the [[#Fertile period 11-15]].
Progesterone prevents the release of eggs and further thickens the uterine lining

## Menstruation (1-5)
The uterine lining breaks down and flows out of the body through the vagina
## Growth and repair (6-10)
Uterine lining regrows and becomes thicker because oestrogen controls the growth of the uterine lining.
## Fertile period (11-15)
Oestrogen peaks around this periods, causing the releasing of eggs which is the fertile period where sperms are able to survive for around 48 hours. This causes progesterone to slowly increase to prevent more eggs from releasing,
## Maintaining of uterine lining (15-28)
The progesterone levels become high while oestrogen levels dip slightly to further thicken the uterine lining to prepare for an embryo if the person is pregnant,. Else the cycle repeats itself.
