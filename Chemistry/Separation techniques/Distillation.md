# Simple Distillation
![[Simple distillation.jpg|400]]
Simple distillation separates a ==pure== solvent from a solution (eg water and alcohol)
1. the mixture is heated in a distillation flask until the temperature reaches the boiling point of the pure liquid.
2. The vapour rises into the condenser and is cooled to form a pure liquid by condensation.
3. The pure liquid is collected at the receiving flask
4. Impurities that are unable to be distillate will be left in the distillation flask as the residue

The condenser in the middle is used to cool the vapour that was evaporated to the chamber for effective condensation.
The bulb of the thermometer is placed to measure the temperature of the vapour like it's boiling point.
# Fractional Distillation

Fractional distillation is used to separate more than 2 types of liquid in a liquid-liquid mixture

It is used to separate petroleum into different useful fractions like petroleum gas, petrol, kerosene and diesel.
It is also used to separate gases to obtain nitrogen, oxygen and argon from liquefied air.
