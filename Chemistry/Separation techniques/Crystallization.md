# Crystallization
It is used to separate solids from a solid-liquid mixture.

It is useful when the solid is easily decomposable where [[Evaporation to dryness]] would not be suitable since it separates most of the solvent into a saturated solution.

Crystals will be formed after it has been left to cool. To test if the solution is saturated, dip a glass rod into the mixture and remove it immediately. If crystals are being formed, the mixture is saturated.
