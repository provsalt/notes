# Paper chromatography 
It is used to separate different substances, especially pigment. An example could be used in food dyes.

Different substances have different solubility and paper chromatography takes advantage of it where the substances travel higher due to it being more soluble

The starting line is drawn with a pencil to not dissolve in the solvent and interfere with results while the starting line should be above the solvent level so that the dye doesn't dissolve before the experiment starts.
