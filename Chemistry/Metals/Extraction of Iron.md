# Extraction of iron
Iron is extracted from haematite (Iron ore) Fe₂O₃,
To extract the iron from the blast furnace of course need to add haematite, coke (C) and limestone (CaCO₃)

## Steps to extract
1. Produce carbon dioxide from coke by burning in the hot air of the blast furnace which will eventually react with more coke to form carbon monoxide 
```ad-example
C (s) + O₂ (g) -> CO₂ (g)

CO₂ (g) + C (s) -> 2CO (g)
```
2. Reduce iron oxide (haematite) to form molten iron ()
```ad-example
Fe₂O₃ (s) + 3CO (g) -> 2Fe (l) + 3CO₂ (g)
```
3. Remove impurities from the molten iron with limestone
```ad-example
Limestone when heated will decompose to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide
CaCO₃ (s) -> CaO (s) + CO₂ (g)
Calcium oxide will then react with acidic impurities such as sand (silicon oxide) to form slag
CaO (s) + SiO₂ (s) -> CaSIO₃ )l
```
