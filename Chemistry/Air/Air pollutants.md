# Air pollutants
Air pollutants are high concentration of chemicals that may harm living and non living things.

Examples include:
1. [[#Carbon monoxide]]
2. [[#Sulfur dioxide]]
3. [[#Oxides of nitrogen]]

## Carbon monoxide
CO or carbon monoxide comes from incomplete combustion of [[Hydrocarbons]] which binds to haemoglobin in the [[Blood]] to form carboxyhaemoglobin reducing efficiency of [[Respiration]].. This may cause headaches and fatigues and even death.
## Sulfur dioxide
SO₂ or sulfur dioxide is found in combustion of fossil fuels which contains sulfur ie: coal and is also found in volcanic eruptions.  Related to [[Risks of living near volcanoes]]. This can lead to eye and lung irritation and causes [[Acid rain]]
## Oxides of nitrogen
Or NO and NO₂ is formed from internal combustion engines and lightning activity due to nitrogen combining with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide
```ad-info
N₂(g) + O₂(g) -> 2NO(g)
2NO(g) + O₂(g) -> 2NO₂(g) 
```
This can lead to eye and lung irritation and causes [[Acid rain]]
