# Reaction with MBC
[[Acids]] + MBC (metal, insoluble base and metal carbonate) forms non GA1 salts.
```ad-important
Acid + metal -> salt + hydrogen
Acid + insoluble base -> salt + water
Acid + insoluble metal carbonate -> salt + water + carbon dioxide
```
Example with carbonate
```ad-example
Hydrochloric acid + copper(II) carbonate -> copper(II) chloride + water + carbon dioxide
```

1. Add excess MBC into a beaker of acid (It's important to add excess MBC to ensure all the acid is used up in the reaction)
2. Filter the mixture to obtain the solution of dissolved salt in water
3. Heat the mixture to saturation to perform [[Crystallization]]
4. Leave the solution to cool to form crystals
5. Wash crystals with distilled water to remove impurities and dry it with filter paper
