# Titration
Titration is a method to prepare soluble [[Salts]] by [[Neutralization|Neutralizing]] acid with bases.
```ad-example
Nitric acid + sodium hydroxide -> sodium nitrate + water
```
1. Titrate the acid with an alkali or carbonate using an indicator such as methyl orange until the end point.
2. Record the amount of alkali used (reading from the bottom of the manicure) and repeat the experiment without an indicator.
3. Heat the resulting solution to saturation to perform [[Crystallization]]
4. Let the solution cool to form crystals and [[Filtration|Filter]] the mixture to collect crystals of salt.
5. Wash the crystals with distilled water to remove impurities and dry them with filter paper
