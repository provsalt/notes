# Three matter of state
|                      | Solid                                                               | Liquid                                                                    | Gas                                         |

| Arrangement          | Particles are closely packed with one another                       | Particles are closely packed together and arranged in a disorderly manner | Particles are far apart from each other     |
| Motion               | Particles vibrate around fixed positions                            | Particles will slide over each other                                      | Particles move rapidly at random directions |
| Forces of attraction | Particles are held together by **very strong** forces of attraction | Particles are held by **strong** forces of attraction                     | Very Weak forces                                             |

## Changes of state
Changes of state happens when particles gain or lose heat energy. When heat energy is absorbed, particles gain energy and move faster. When heat energy is lost, the particles will lose energy and hence move slower.
This is why [[State changes]] occur.
