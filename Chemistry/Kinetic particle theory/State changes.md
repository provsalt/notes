# Different state changes
## Melting (S -> L)
When a solid is being heated, heat energy is absorbed by the particles and will gain kinetic energy as a result and starts to vibrate faster

At melting point, the particles will vibrate faster and more vigorously, sufficient energy is able to overcome the strong forces of attraction and this particles move further away apart. 

The liquid is now formed and hence melting has occurred.
## Boiling (L -> G)
When a liquid is being heated, heat energy is absorbed by the particles and will gain kinetic energy as a result and starts to vibrate faster

At boiling point, sufficient energy is able to overcome the strong forces of attraction and the particles are able to move further apart in and freely in all directions

A gas is now formed and hence boiling has occurred.
## Sublimation (S -> G)
Sublimation happens when solid directly changes to gas without going through the liquid state.

This happens due to the particles on the surface of the solid gains enough energy to overcome the attractions of forces between the particles and break away from it's fixed position to escape as a gas.
## Freezing (L -> S)
Freezing occurs when a liquid is being cooled and thus loses kinetic energy and move slower.
At melting point, the particles lose energy and moves even slower to a fixed postion

A solid is now formed and hence freezing has happened
## Condensation (G -> L)
Condensation happens when a gas is being cooled where heat energy is being absorbed by the particles which will cause them to move slower. When cooled to their boiling point, the particle give out energy and move closer together to a random position.

Thus, condensation has occurred and liquid is now formed.
