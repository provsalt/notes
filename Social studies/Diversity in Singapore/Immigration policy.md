# Immigration policy
Singapore has one of the most lenient immigration in the world to meet our manpower needs. 
Due to [[Globalisation]] and cheaper transport, more migrant workers are able to come to Singapore to work.

In 1960s and 1970s, there is greater demand for more workers to do labour intensive work such as construction of buildings.

In 1980s, Singapore is more developed and has progressed to find more professionals due to Singapore facing brain drain where professionals in Singapore migrate to other countries for better [[Economic opportunities]] or education opportunism.
