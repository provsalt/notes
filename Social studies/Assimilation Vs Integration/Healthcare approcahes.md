# Healthcare approach
There are 3 ways to manage and respond to healthcare
1. Market based approach
2. Government Financed approach
3. Shared responsibilities 

## Market based approach
The citizens are given the freedom to decide on how much they should pay for healthcare and the government does not intervene with the choices of healthcare services nor the prices.

This approach causes more problems than it solves as companies are incentive to profit which may cause insane market prices for certain medicine in the US.

There has been certain policies amended to address healthcare challenges
1. Medicare which is a form of insurance for Americans older than 65 years old and those with disabilities and permanent kidney failure
2. Medicaid which is a form of health insurance available for people with low income.
3. Obamacare in 2014 which allowed lower [[Socio-economic status]] to get financial subsidies

Financial subsidies in the US may not be very effective with a market based approach as it only encourages more companies to increase prices for medication for the government to pay it using subsidies and people who are not able to afford may die.

Eg: Mark Cuban in 2022 launched the [Cost Plus Drugs Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_Plus_Drugs) where they get supplies from the manufacture directly and sell it for a cheaper price as it skips the middleman and allows consumers to save a thousands of dollars

## Government Financed approach
This approach is usually used in Europe, particularly the Nordic countries such as Sweden where healthcare is fully subsidies by the government for the citizens as they belief that all citizens should have access to healthcare regardless of their background.

However these comes with [[Trade offs]] where there'll be high taxation rate in the country to keep up with the free healthcare they offer.
Due to [[Homogenisation]], with [[Globalisation]], citizens from the EU are also eligible which places a strain on countries like Sweden.
Aging population may also cause more taxation for the working people which may cause them to leave the country, leading to brain drain.

## Shared responsibilities
In Singapore, there is a balance between the government's and citizen's responsibility to healthcare where costs are kept affordable by giving quite heavy subsidies for healthcare.

CPF also includes Medisave, Medishield life and Medifund where Medisave used to pay for smaller bills while Medishield life helps to pay with larger hospital bills. Medifund would provide help to needy Singaporeans on behalf of the government.
