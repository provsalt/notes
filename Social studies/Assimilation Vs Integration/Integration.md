# Integration
Integration retains people's unique identities while forging common grounds with the social groups that are already living in the country

## Integration policy in Singapore
- Bilingual policy
	Singapore has the bilingual policy where Singaporeans have to learn both English (common language shared from [[Diversity]]) and their mother tongue languages.
	This allows them to communicate while retaining and preserving their original cultural identity and heritage.
- Presidential Council of Minority Rights
	The council is setup to ensure all laws that are passed in the parliament by the[[Organ of states#Legislature|Legislatures]] do not discriminate any race/religion and ensures that they're fair to all.
- Group Representation Constituency
	This policy ensures that at least 1 member of a GRC is from a minority ethnic community
- Ethnic integration policy
	 This policy ensure that there is sufficient interactions between neighbours of different backgrounds and foster harmony among other groups with more [[Common spaces]]

## Naturalisation initiatives
Singapore has a process of naturalisation to ensure that migrants are able to integrate to the diverse society of Singapore.
Eg: Singapore citizenship journey where there is a 3 part programme between the People's association and National integration council.
	This program allows new citizens to learn about Singapore's culture at their own pace online and has a community sharing session whereby they reflect on their journey towards citizenship and their hopes and aspirations for Singapore.
	The program also features a Singapore experience tour whereby they are brought to historic landmarks in Singapore to learn about Singapore's history and management.

## Common experiences and community support
Singapore has excellent common experiences as suggested in chapter 6 through [[Common spaces]] and has excellent community support as discussed in chapter 5 [[Socio-cultural environment#Community support]]
