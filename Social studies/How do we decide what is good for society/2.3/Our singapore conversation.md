# Singapore conversation
- The exercise enabled national level conversations where citizens can come together and share their hopes, dreams., views and ideas about what matters to SG

- This usually is conducted through tens of thousands of people from various sectors

- As a result, the government learnt about Singaporeans aspirations, and Singaporeans also learnt more about each others hopes for the future.

- Singaporeans develop a stronger bond with each other as they shared common hopes and dreams.

- By presenting their aspirations to everyone, they will be more inspired and inclined to work towards achieving their dreams and not just rely on the government to work hard.
