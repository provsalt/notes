#ss
It's hard to define what is good for the society and at times, trade-offs has to be made to select what is good for society as a whole to get more benefits vs the cost

This can lead to disagreements on changes as there are people with different needs and priorities

Eg: Older generation may want better and more affordable healthcare, Students may want better education.

Some groups of people will bear greater cost at the expense of others
