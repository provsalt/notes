# Greater diversity in SG
There has been greater diversity in SG due to these driving factors. 
1. [[Immigration policy]]
2. [[Economic opportunities]]
3. [[Socio-cultural environment]]

These factors causes more immigrants to come to Singapore and eventually settle down in Singapore and start families, this increases Singapore's diversity.
