There has been more economical incentives for immigrants to migrate to Singapore due to the ease of setting up a business here and has a stable political environment,

For example, Multi-national companies such as Dyson (TYS 2021) has moved to Singapore to enter the Asia market to increase their profits. 

With more MNCs coming to Singapore, there will be more workers required, this decreases the unemployment rate in Singapore and attracts more workers to immigrate.
