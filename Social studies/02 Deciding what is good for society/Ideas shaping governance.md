- **Y**....

## Having good leadership
The leaders and government must be capable, honest and non corrupt to ensure that **right decisions** are made for the good of the country and manages [[Trade offs]] properly even if the decision is not popular among people.

## Anticipating changes and staying relevant
The country has to stay relevant or it will be behind other countries and lose out due to [[Globalisation]]. These decisions have to be made for the benefit of the people in the long run 
### NEWater 
(self reliant, 4 taps)
will not lose out due to malaysia not selling water to SG

### Integrated resorts
Economic tensions vs Social tensions
- The government was aware of the social consequences such as gambling addictions and implemented measures to curtail the potential impact of problem gambling.
- If they built integrated resorts, they'll be able to earn more money from rich tourist who are looking to gamble their money in casinos

Volatile
Uncertain
Complex
Ambiguous 

## Providing a stake for everyone
Providing a stake gives opportunities for people to contribute to the decision making in SG
- Leads to stronger sense of belonging
### OSC
Very important as people can give feedback to the government and government from different sectors can use data to work towards their goals.
Refer to [[Our singapore conversation]] for more details

### PHS (Public house scheme)
1.  The PHS enables many SGs to own their own homes, for example through the provision of housing grants. 
2.  A couple who applies for the Special Central Provident fund (CF) Housing grant and may qualify for the additional CPF housing grant.Â 
3.  A stake for everyone, opportunity for all is essential for the progress of the nation.
4.  Owning their own homes contributes to the citizens having a greater sense of belonging to SG and they will work towards making it their most asset.

## Practising meritocracy
Meritocracy is a system which rewards people for their hard work and talent. Regardless of race, religion and SES
### Schools
In schools, meritocracy is practiced by giving edusave awards, scholarships and edusave bursaries to hard-working students regardless of race, ethnicity, SES. This encourages students to work towards being in the 10 or 25% of top scorers.
However, this may not be useful as richer families are able to afford tuition to help their children to learn easier and provide a head start for them which will not be good for other people.

### Work
Workers are given bonuses, pay raise etc as they work hard for the company.
This encourages workers to work harder for their company to get pay raise and get promoted to a higher level in the company. As a result, the company will get to benefit as the [[GDP]] of singapore will increase.
