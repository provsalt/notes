# Cultural homogenisation
Cultural homogenisation is the process where local culture is being changed by foreign culture to become more similar with aspects of foreign culture
```ad-example
This can range from food, music, films and languages
```
This may pose a threat to the local culture and the local culture may be lost., decreasing the [[Diversity]] of a country. However some may reject the idea of foreign culture to protect local culture.
