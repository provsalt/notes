In France, 40% of TV programmes must be in French to keep the idea of assimilation in France and preserve the national identity.

```ad-example
In Japan, thousands of protestors protested in front of the headquarters of Fuji Television, a Japanese Televsion network as locals expressed unhappiness with the increasing presence of Korean programmes.

## American influence
Majority of the world has been influenced by the Americans in the entertainment industry where American companies earn 30% of the worldwide entertainment revenue.
These films may influence the message of freedom in America to the rest of the world.
[[MNC]]'s such as McDonald's has opened more chains around the world and hybridised different menus around the world to cater to locals.
```ad-note
In 1986, Italians protested against McDonald's plans to build their fast food restaurants in Italy as they saw it as an extension of American culture. However, McDonald's stays open in Italy till this day with a hybrid American and Italian menu
