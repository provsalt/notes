# Exchange and appreciation of culture
There are 3 main ideas that can be appreciated with culture. Through [[Cultural hybridisation]], there has been more blending of all the diverse culture in Singapore.

Deeper appreciation and understanding could develop if we are open and we learn and share with other, experiencing enriching experiences as a result.
Sharing is often done in HDBs such as exchange of food during CNY/Hari raya/Deepavali

Some examples include fusion of food, fashion and music.
