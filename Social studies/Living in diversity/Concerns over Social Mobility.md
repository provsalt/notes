# Concerns over social mobility
Income gap has been widening over time in Singapore as discussed in [[Socio-economic status]] in chapter 5. This causes Singaporeans to feel that there is limited social mobility and hard to move up the socio-economic status ladder. Loss of jobs may have an impact on Singaporeans to progress up the socio-economic ladder.

The government has been trying to keep Singaporeans attractive to employers looking to hire locals.
Eg:
- Re-training and continuous learning with free Skillsfuture credits to Singaporeans.
- In schools, [[Ideas shaping governance#Practising meritocracy]] to ensure that Singaporeans are motivated to study hard and be recognized and be more prepared for the work force.
