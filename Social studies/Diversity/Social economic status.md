# Social-economical status
SES is determined by a person's income, education and ownership.

There are 3 main social economical status
1.  [[Social economic status#Low SES]]
1.  [[Social economic status#Middle SES]]
1.  [[Social economic status#High SES]]

## Low SES
People of lower SES usually do not posses a lot of wealth and may not have enough financial means to support themselves.
Usually also take on "blue-collar" jobs which do not require much skills involved and may receive more subsidies from the government such as FAS and CHAS
## Middle SES
Middle SES is a broad group as it is between low and high.
Typically takes on "white-collar" jobs which are jobs performed in offices such as PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians)
## High SES
People with high SES are usually born into wealthy families or accumulated their wealth from work and investments. Therefore, they live with a good lifestyle by having access to better housing, food and modes of transport.
They may also have access to better education and hence why [[Ideas shaping governance#Practising meritocracy|Practicing meritocracy]] could be unfair to a certain extent.


These days, there is a lower social mobility and it is harder for a lower social-economical status to move up to high, vice-versa. This is causing an issue as the income gap between lower social-economical status and the higher is becoming greater and greater.
