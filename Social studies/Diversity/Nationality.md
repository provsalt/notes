# Nationality
There are multiple different nationalities in Singapore where beyond [[Citizenship#Legal status]] it also means to have a strong sense of belonging to the country and sharing common experiences with others of the same nationality through [[Common spaces]]

Usually, people of the same nationality live in a rather close geographical area who share a common language (singlish? lol) and have a common tradition. People who live in the same country may feel more comfortable with people of the same nationality as they can identify with common experiences.

Eg: Singaporeans celebrate National day on 9th of august every year to mark it's independences from Malaysia and progress as a country.
