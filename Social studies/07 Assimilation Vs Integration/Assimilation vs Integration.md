# [[Assimilation]] vs [[Integration]]
There are all [[Trade offs]] for certain groups in societies for all government approaches towards managing diversity while assimilation in France creates a strong national identity, immigrants may not be comfortable to give up any form of religious expressions in public.

Immigration on the other hand in Singapore allows immigrants to retain their unique identities but there may be insufficient efforts for the immigrant to blend into an Integration society and unable to form social networks with locals.
