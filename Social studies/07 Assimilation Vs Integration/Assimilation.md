Assimilation adopts the believes and practices of the majority group in the country and there will become like the rest of the majority group.

## Assimilation in France
The idea of secularism is practiced to put aside differences in [[Race and ethnicity]], [[Race and ethnicity]] and [[Socio-economic status]] and achieve harmony.
Article 1 of the French constitution ensures equality before the law for all citizens.

However, there has been acknowledgement of [[Diversity]] but it doesn't overshadow the national identity.

## Policies
### Education
The schools are not allowed to discuss about religion except in History and Philosophy classes.

There are also adaptation classes for children of immigrants before they are able to join French schools. This allows them to pick up their culture before they interact with anyone else and prevents misunderstanding as they understand the French way of life.

However children may lose some of their ethnic and culture influences before coming to France.

### Employment
Immigrants are encouraged to pick up French as it allows them to be accepted into work easier as they are able to interact and understand each other easier which leads to more acceptance.
	However, there is still discrimination against immigrants where they are less likely to be employed which makes it feel ineffective

### Naturalisation initiatives
Learn and develop basic knowledge about life in France. 
All immigrants are to go through the French language course and attend a day of civic education to obtain permanent residency.
