# Safeguarding the interests of citizens
Government implements [[Organ of states#Legislature]] that will safeguard the interest of citizens to ensure that they will have a sense of security of living in the country
## Workright initiative 
1.  The government introduced the WorkRight Initiative to help both employees and employers understand their rights and responsibility respectively
2.  The initiative is intended to create awareness of employment rights amongst low-wage workers and better ensure retirement security for this group of workers.
3.  Only when employers are more cognizant of their responsibilities can they do a better job of looking after the rights and welfare of their workers.
4.  This ensures that both employers and employees know what is in store for them and they do face any negative repercussions of the other’s actions.

## Central provision fund (CPF)
1.  CPF helps citizens prepare for retirement as they and their employer are able to save money for retirement.
2.  CPF helps Singaporeans to finance their housing needs, healthcare needs and for them to have a source of lifelong income in retirement.
3.  Since Singaporean life expectancy is increasing, Singaporeans have to save more to last them through a longer retirement or they may end up outliving their savings.
4.  To address the issue, CPF LIFE was introduced in 2009 to provide Singaporeans with a lifelong monthly pay out in retirement to give them a greater peace of mind in retirement
5.  Together with the risk-free interest paid by the government, CPF helps Singaporeans to stretch their retirement savings for as long as they live. 
6.  Therefore, as the government helps to reduce the stress that retirees may feel due to monetary issues, the government is working for the good of the society by safeguarding their interests and spending resources and coming up with schemes in order to help the citizens.
