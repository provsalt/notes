# Accounting cycle
The accounting cycle is the process of accounting transactions through the accounting information system done by an accountant.

1. Identifying and recording business transactions. The business will first verify that the transaction has taken place by using [[Source documents]] and recording it in journal entries and eventually recording in ledger accounts.
2. Adjusting. The [[Trial balance]] and [[Bank reconciliation]] statement may reveal arithmetic errors or errors caused by timing differences. [[Corrections of errors]] will be done to adjust the correct amounts.
3. Reporting. Create financial statements for [[Stakeholders]] to make informed decisions.
4. Closing of accounts. All income and expenses accounts are closed in the end of the financial year to income summary.
