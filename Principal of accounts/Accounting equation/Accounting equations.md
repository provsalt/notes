# Accounting equation
Assets = Equity + Liability
Hence [[Financial position]] total assets has to be equals to total equity + liability

## Expanded equation
Assets = Liabilities + Capital - Drawings + Income/ - Expense
This is because [[Equity|Capital]] is equals to previous year capital + profit/loss
