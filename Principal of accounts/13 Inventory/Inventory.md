# Inventory
Inventory is a current asset that is valued at either list price or net realisable value whichever is lower.
This is because prudence theory states that profit and assets (inventory) should not be overstated and losses and liabilities should not be understated 

## Impairment loss on inventory
Impairment loss occurs when the inventory is damaged and the value of the inventory is no longer as valuable because the net realisable value has dropped.
