# First in first out
The first in first out system ensures that goods that are purchased earliest are assumed to be sold out first and what is left in the [[Inventory]] are the goods that are purchased latest.

In the inventory account, you should always record in cost price that you purchased the goods and not the value that you earned from selling of goods.
