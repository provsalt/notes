# Internal controls
Internal controls act as methods to steal cash harder as cash is highly portable and can be stolen easily. 
## Segregation of duties
Segregate the handling of cash and the receiving of cash among different employees so that no single person has control to all the cash.
## Custody of cash
Secure cash and cheque in a secured lock storage and only provide access to authorized personnel to the cash.
## Authorisation
Require approvals for all payments from an authorized personnel before payments to be reviewed and approved.
## Bank reconciliation statement
Ensure the differences between the bank statement and the business cash at bank account is caused due to timing differences in transaction and not any unauthorized transactions.
