# Non-current assets
Non current assets are assets that the business owns or controls that are expected to provide future benefits beyond 1 year to generate income.
However, matching theory states that income earned has to be matched against expenses incurred and therefore depreciation has to be accounted for.
## Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure is the cost incurred to buy and bring the non-current asset to it's intended use (eg delivery). It could be classified under capital expenditure if it's also to improve the non-current asset.
## Revenue expenditure
Revenue expenditure is the cost to operate, maintain and repair a non-current asset. It is also classified as an expense

## Depreciation
Non-current assets can be depreciated due to 4 reasons.
1. Wear and tear (physical damage)
2. Obsolescence (NCA is old)
3. Legal limits (eg: hdb 99 year lease)
4. Usage
```ad-info
Depreciation complies with the [[Miscellaneous theories#Historical cost theory]] as it shows that there is a decline due to the usage of non current assets while still recording the non current asset in it's original price in the financial position.

### Methods of depreciation
Straight line method = (cost - scrap value)  / useful life

Reducing balance method = Net book value * rate of depreciation
### Materiality theory 
Materiality theory states that relevant information should be reported in the financial statements if it's unlikely to make a difference to the decision-making process. If the business is rich, certain capital expenditure can be considered revenue expenditure as it is insignificant to the business. 

## Consistancy theory
Consistancy theory states that the depreciation method should not be changed once decided for meaningful comparison.
